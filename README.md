# TrajecySimulation
Use Matlab to simulate the two dimensional motion trajectories of nine planets .
###how to use
Just run the file in Matlab app,then you will see an image is being drawn.
###description
Since the nine planets have different parameters such as mass and eccentricity, their motion periods can be calculated separately according to Kepler's three laws and simulated and displayed through code.

####Notes:
Please zoom in while the program is running to see all the planetary trajectories
